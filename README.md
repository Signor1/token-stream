By utilizing smart contracts, low transaction fees, and high throughput on Polygon Amoy, TRiver offers secure and efficient token streaming functionalities.

TRiver aims to elevate the user experience and operational efficiency within DeFi projects, providing seamless, uninterrupted transactions backed by the security and transparency of blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement

Many major subscription services lack crypto payment options, and employers seeking to pay salaries in crypto face challenges in loading addresses and automating payments.

## Solution

TRiver enables subscription services like Netflix to integrate their modules onto our platform, allowing users to subscribe to services and automate payments seamlessly.

## Business Logic

TRiver targets onboarding existing web2 services offering subscriptions, such as DSTV, Starlink, and Netflix. We generate income by charging both companies and users for transactions made through the platform. As we scale, we plan to introduce custom subscriptions and premium plans to further increase our income.

Collaborations with partners and other products will help attract users and expand our client base. Future prospects include expanding to more custom subscription-based services and automated staking rewards.

## Implementation

- Chainlink automation using upkeep.
